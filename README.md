### Learned skills so far:

- Learning React and TypeScript
- React hooks: useState, useContext, useRef, useEffect
- Encapsulating my game logic so that this project can be more easily re-factored in the future to include a variety of similar trick-based card games
- Learned how to use async/await and resolving Promises
- Gained experience in building an intuitative user interface and comfortable user experience
- Organizing my project: Models, interfaces, components and functions are in their separate locations

### Getting started

1. `npm install`

2. `npm run dev`
